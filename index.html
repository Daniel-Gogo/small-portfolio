        <h2>Hello</h2>
        <p class="intro">I am Daniel Fawari Gogo. I am an aspiring full stack developer, and i am currently a student at the university of port-harcourt.
          I developed a little insight in coding late 2021 and ever since it's been bliss . I started out at Aptech computer Education India 
          where i got a little insight to html and css and i also bagged my first diploma degree in front end web development.
          The programme had taken place for about 6 months. I wasn't satisfied as i had found out the tech world was constantly evolving, so i opted to 
          learn more languages .I then delved into learning libraries such as bootstrap, a little bit of javascript and some php at an academy known as Edsofta where 
          i also bagged another certificate.
          Currently, I school at the university of Portharcourt and have been lately preoccupied then, i bumped into a great course on Udemy to get me back on track.
          Hopefully, I master full stack, get my valid certificate and get a good job while schooling.

          <h3>PROGRAMMING AND CODING</h3>
          <p>Writing code has grown to be one of my favorite hobbies over the past years and it has evolved into a great skill.

          with an excellent library as bootstrap, i am pretty sure i am ready to move on to the next phase and see what next the tech world has to offer. 
        i am all for itüòä</p>

          <h3>CREATIVE WRITING AND POETRY</h3>
          <p>I have always been a sucker for good write-ups with a few books to be published soon and i also perform poetry once in a while
            at exhibitions. Writing has always been an ideal way to connect with the mind of the audience and i do this effortlessly.
